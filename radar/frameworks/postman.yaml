description: |
  Postman is an API testing and development tool. At the core are Postman Collections which
  is an executable description of an API. With Postman Collections you can mock, test,
  document and monitor your API.
rationale: |
  Postman is a great tool for testing and mocking APIs. It can be used for
  integration tests in your CI/CD pipelines by leveraging the `newman` CLI.

  Our main interest in Postman at the moment is as a testing platform and an IDE
  to help during development. We don't see it as a source for documenting our APIs.
