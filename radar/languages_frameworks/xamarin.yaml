description: |
  Xamarin is a Microsoft-maintained framework for cross-platform development and deployment of mobile applications.
  With a C#-shared code base, developers can use Xamarin tools to write native Android, iOS, and Windows applications with
  native user interfaces and share code across multiple platforms, including Windows and macOS.
  According to Xamarin, over 1.4 million developers were using Xamarin's products in 120 countries around the world as
  of Apil 2017.

rationale: |
  There are many reasons we use Xamarin at Extenda Retail. A primary rational is that Xamarin adopts the
  philosophy of code once, run everywhere and is a big time saver and quality assurer when developing mobile
  applications. This reduces the need for multiple dedicated platform specific development and deployment teams.

  When developing with Xamarin one gets the added benefit of having application versioning be synchronized between
  platforms.

  Xamarin has some limitations and should not be the framework of choice when applications with performance focus
  or low level functionality, such as 3d graphics and low level sensor data manipulation, is of importance.
