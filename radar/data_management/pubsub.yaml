  [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/architecture) is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications.

  By providing many-to-many, asynchronous messaging that decouples senders and receivers, it allows for secure and highly available communication among independently written applications.
rationale: |
  Pub/Sub brings the flexibility and reliability of enterprise message-oriented middleware to the cloud. At the same time, Cloud Pub/Sub is a scalable, durable event ingestion and delivery system that serves as a foundation for modern stream analytics pipelines.
  Cloud Pub/Sub delivers low-latency, durable messaging that helps developers quickly integrate systems hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and externally

  The service is provided and managed by Google Cloud.
  This means that the cost and need for involvement on an operational level is eliminated.
  Maintained by Google Clouds SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), the system stays up and running efficiently with no worries about [uptime](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/sla).
  More in-depth data processing is possible with [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-streaming/).
